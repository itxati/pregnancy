Nutrition


What & How Much

  For infants (0-6 months): Exclusive breastfeeding is best where possible. The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasises that every child has the right to good nutrition and notes that many infants globally are not exclusively breastfed. (World Health Organization)
  Transition to complementary (solid) foods from ~6 months: meals should be nutrient-dense, include multiple food groups, prepared hygienically, and eaten frequently. (UNICEF)
  For toddlers (~12–24 months): The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says offer something to eat or drink every 2–3 hours (about 3 meals + 2–3 snacks). (CDC)
   For older children (3-8 years): Focus on balanced diet: fruits/vegetables, whole grains, lean
proteins, low-fat dairy, limit added sugars & sodium. (CDC)
  General guideline: For example, the Mayo Clinic says: proteins (seafood, lean meat, beans, etc), plenty of fruits & vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy. (Mayo Clinic)
Key Nutrients & Habits

  Iron: Especially critical in infancy and toddler years — iron-rich foods should be offered early.   Calcium & Vitamin D: For bone health, especially when the child is older and more active.
  Limit added sugars and ultra-processed snacks: The nutrition industry notes that many children consume too much sugar and sodium.
  Fat intake: For children 2-3 years, total fat may be ~30-35% of calories; for older children ~25- 35% (with fats from good sources)..
Feeding Habits

  Routine: Encourage consistent meal/snack times so the child knows mealtime structure (supports appetite and digestion).
  Self-feeding & autonomy: For toddlers/preschoolers, let them try feeding themselves (with supervision) — finger foods, small spoons, encourage independence.
  Family meals: Children learn by watching caregivers’ eating habits — when they see healthy eating, they tend to mimic.
   Variety & texture progression: At ~6 months start soft purees → mashed → chopped → family-
food textures by ~2-3 years.
  Responsive feeding: Watch hunger/fullness cues; don’t force eat. The CDC notes children might go through phases of eating less and that’s normal.
  Limit screen time during meals: Although not a core nutrition guideline, less distraction at meals helps children tune into hunger/fullness cues and fosters better eating habits.
Impact on Development & School Readiness
Good nutrition supports brain growth, cognitive development, energy regulation and physical health
— all of which tie into being ready for school (attention, behaviour, stamina). One guideline states: “Nutritious foods … should be offered throughout the day to ensure children are getting the nourishment and energy they need to learn, grow
 
Local-ised Tips for Pakistan

  Use local foods: lentils (dal), whole wheat chapati, fresh seasonal fruits/vegetables, and local lean protein sources (eggs, chicken, fish) to make the diet relatable.
   Water & hygiene: Emphasize clean water for cooking/feeding, safe storage.
  Snack ideas: Instead of sugary biscuits, propose yogurt with fruit, roasted chickpeas, fresh fruit slices.
  Cultural and family context: Encourage extended family involvement, sharing meals, and involving older siblings in helping.
   Micronutrient monitoring: Since iron‐deficiency anemia is common in South Asia, you could
include a “check iron” reminder around toddler age.
  Growth tracking: Consider including local growth standards or WHO charts, and prompt caregiver if growth is lagging for their region.

Schooling / Early Childhood Education


What is School Readiness?
“School readiness” is more than knowing letters/numbers. It’s a combination of skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that enable a child to begin school and thrive.
Key domains include:

  Social-emotional development: self-control, forming relationships, recognising feelings, cooperating with others.
   Cognitive / general knowledge: problem-solving, curiosity, early math, understanding cause &
effect
  Language & literacy: vocabulary, storytelling, letter recognition, asking/answering questions.
  Physical & motor development: fine motor skills (holding a pencil), gross motor (running, jumping), stamina to sit and focus.
   Approaches to learning / executive function / self-regulation: ability to focus, shift attention,
follow directions, impulse control. Research shows self-regulation is strongly tied to readiness.

Age-wise progression & what caregivers can do
You can build into your app weekly/monthly activities for each age window. Birth to ~3 years
  Encourage lots of talking, reading, singing. Respond to baby’s cues (turn-taking).   Play: simple cause-and-effect toys, sensorimotor exploration, safe environment.   Social: snuggling, interacting, imitating, simple turn-taking.
   Self-help: allow safe exploration, picking up items, simple decisions (with supervision).

3–5 years (pre-school stage)

   Fine-motor: drawing, simple crafts, using scissors (with help)
 
  Language & literacy: tell stories together, ask “what happens next?”, introduce letters/numbers through play
  Social-emotional: cooperative play, sharing, recognising others’ feelings, taking turns   Cognitive: sorting games, puzzles, counting objects, simple board games
  Routine & self-help skills: dressing (with help), going to toilet independently, cleaning up toys, following simple two-step instructions
  Transition to a group setting: Encourage play groups or preschool to get used to routines, group interaction.
5–8 years (early school age)

  Reading readiness: Recognising letters, attempting words, reading for fun.
  Numeracy: Counting, basic addition/subtraction, understanding shapes, patterns.   Attention span: Ability to sit for a short story or task, follow multi-step instructions.
  Self-management: Packing school bag, being responsible for small tasks, following classroom rules.
   Social skills: Making and keeping friends, resolving small conflicts, cooperating in teams.
  Health & physical: Good sleep, regular meals, outdoor play, and independence in bathroom/hygiene.
