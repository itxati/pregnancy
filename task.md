Teething / Dental Development (2 to 8 years period relevance)
By age 2–3, primary (baby) teeth eruption is (in most children) complete or nearly complete.
•	The typical sequence (for baby teeth) is:
o	3–13 months: central incisors (upper & lower) (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
o	8–16 months: lateral incisors (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
o	13–19 months: first molars (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
o	15–23 months: canines (cuspids) (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
o	25–33 months: second molars (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
•	By age 2–3 years, the full set of 20 primary teeth is usually in place. (womenandchildren.avisena.com.my)
•	After that age, the focus is on dental hygiene, prevention of decay, supervision of brushing, and monitoring for alignment or orthodontic red flags.
•	Tooth decay (caries) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases. Even though baby teeth fall out, their health influences permanent teeth and chewing, speech, etc.




Vaccination (Immunization) for Ages 2 to 8
While the primary immunization schedule is often concentrated in infancy and early toddler years, there are boosters and school age vaccinations to consider. Vaccination schedules differ by country, so your app should adapt by region. Below is a general sketch:
•	Many national immunization schedules include booster doses (e.g. Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis) in early childhood (around 4–6 years)
•	Some countries include measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), varicella (chickenpox), polio boosters, influenza yearly, etc.
•	Check local (Pakistan or target country) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule.



Schooling / Readiness for School & Early Education
This covers how children integrate into formal or semi-formal education, what skills they need, and what supports help.
Key components / content you may include:
1.	School Readiness Domains
o	Social & emotional (self regulation, cooperation)
o	Language & literacy
o	Numeracy / early maths concepts
o	Physical health & motor coordination
o	Approaches to learning (curiosity, persistence)
2.	Language & Literacy
o	By ages 5–8, children develop phonological awareness, vocabulary, narrative skills, letter-sound correspondence. (c3ta.org)
o	Pre writing and emergent literacy skills matter in preschool years.
3.	Cognitive / Mathematical Thinking
o	Early counting, classification, pattern recognition, basic arithmetic
o	Problem solving, reasoning about concrete objects
o	Introducing computational thinking (in fun ways) is possible (some research explores this even in early years) (arXiv)
4.	Social Skills / Emotional Learning
o	Prosocial behavior, self-control, understanding emotions, conflict resolution
o	Peer interactions, group play, following rules
5.	Curriculum frameworks / standards
o	Many regions have Early Years frameworks (e.g. Victoria’s Early Years Learning & Development Framework covers up to eight years) (Wikipedia)
o	Use of developmentally appropriate practice (DAP) as foundation in early education settings. (Wikipedia)
6.	Transitioning to primary school
o	Preschool to grade 1: support adjustment, bridging curricula, orientation
o	Monitoring children who lag behind to provide remedial support
