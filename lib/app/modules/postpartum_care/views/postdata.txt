Breastfeeding Guidance (Seperate Page)
Early Initiation → Should begin within 1 hour after birth if mother & baby are stable
Skin-to-skin contact → Encourages immediate breastfeeding to:
Stimulate oxytocin release
Trigger milk let-down reflex
Support thermoregulation
Hormonal Control
Prolactin → Stimulates milk production
Oxytocin → Causes milk ejection reflex
Frequency
Newborn should breastfeed 8–12 times/24 hours
On-demand feeding is preferred — cues include:
Rooting, hand to mouth, fussing
