        "Even though you're not yet pregnant, the first day of your last period is when your pregnancy is tracked from. This will be the last period you have for a while! Your body is busy producing the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which gives your ovaries the ability to nurture your eggs. Every maturing egg in your ovaries is held within a follicle, which is secreting the hormone oestrogen at this point. Over the next two weeks, the developing eggs make their way to the surface of your ovary. Here, the dominant follicle will wait until it's almost time to ovulate and release its egg.",

If you've recently had alcohol, don't worry - but as soon as you're thinking about conceiving it's time to stop drinking, as there's no amount that's considered safe in pregnancy.\n\nFocus on your own health and wellbeing - enjoy a balanced diet that's rich in vegetables, fruits, and wholegrains, and ask your doctor about which antenatal vitamins might be right for you. Getting enough sleep and keeping active are also great ways to look after your health in these early weeks!",

        "Ovulation is an exciting time in your body. Even though there are many eggs inside a woman's ovaries, usually only one is released at a time. During ovulation, the egg is released through the ovarian wall and starts its journey through the fallopian tubes to meet the sperm. You may notice slight cramping in the abdomen around ovulation. An increase in cervical mucus, a slippery substance secreted from your vagina, is also a sign of ovulation. The cervical mucus is the sperm's best friend, creating a healthy environment for its travel and allowing it to live for several days in your body. Because your egg can live for only 24 hours after ovulation, timing is of utmost importance to ensure that conception occurs. The egg is usually fertilised in one of the fallopian tubes and travels to your uterus where implantation occurs.",
    healthTips:
        "To enhance your chances of getting pregnant, try to predict the moment of ovulation. Be aware of the changes that signal ovulation, such as an increase in your basal body temperature and cervical mucus. Allow for maximum baby-making time with your partner. Live a healthy lifestyle and keep taking your antenatal vitamins. Most of all, enjoy this time with your partner and marvel at the amazing things going on inside your body.",

        "Some couples 'save up' sex when they're trying to conceive. They believe that having sex less often will result in more sperm and a greater chance of pregnancy when they are finally intimate. Studies, however, have found that's not the best approach. Having sex often is actually the best way to get pregnant (ideally every other day), and so is having intercourse at the right time. The best time to have sex is the three days before, and the day of ovulation. As far as frequency, the studies show going longer intervals between encounters actually decreases sperm count. The best interval is to have sex daily or every other day around the time of ovulation.",

        "One of those millions of sperm has fertilised your egg. DNA from the egg and the sperm combine to form a new cell called a zygote. The zygote divides and keeps on dividing to form a solid mass of cells called the morula. The morula doubles in size about every 12 hours. The morula will change into a blastocyst, which is a fluid-filled space surrounded by hundreds of cells. The sex of your baby has already been determined, as well as the colour of your baby's eyes, hair, and maybe even some personality traits. During the change from zygote to blastocyst, the fertilised cell has moved down the fallopian tube to the uterus. The blastocyst will nestle in the uterine wall; a safe home for your baby's future development. You don't know it yet, but you're pregnant. If the fertilised egg splits into two, identical twins occur. Each baby will then have the same genes. They will be of the same sex and look very alike. Non-identical twins are the result of two eggs being fertilised by two sperms at the same time. The babies may be of the same sex or different sexes, and will probably look no more alike than any other siblings. One-third of all twins are identical, and two-thirds are non-identical.",

Guidelines recommend taking folic acid before pregnancy, and continuing until you're 12 weeks pregnant. If you haven't yet, you can start taking it now. If your go-to foods are making you feel nauseous, substitute them with equally nutritious alternatives.",

Some tests are less sensitive to the hCG hormone. Even though you might think your period is coming, try to avoid taking painkillers to lessen cramps. For those carrying twins, the level of hCG may be higher than with one baby, sometimes an early indicator of a twin pregnancy. Get proper rest, keep taking your prenatal vitamins and be as healthy as you can.",

Your chances of having identical (one egg that splits in half) twins? Better than playing the lottery - about one out of every 250 twin births results in identical twins.
